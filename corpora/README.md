We curated a corpus of writing to use in testing. Here, we give the references for all the texts in our "clean" corpus, which contains pieces from vetted and edited magazines such as *The New Yorker* and *Harper's Magazine*; we expect the linter to run nearly cleanly over this corpus, which we occasionally verify by hand. (We can't distribute the corpus directly because we don't have permission from those holding the copyright.)
